## 📜 Introduction

The implementation of a proper IAM infrastructure requires the involvement of
people from different teams and departments. Underestimating the need to involve
all stakeholders at an early stage will lead to delays, waste of money and
resources, and poor adoption.

The following is an incomplete list of candidate stakeholders:

- Human Resources (HR)
  - People operations
  - Talent acquisition
  - Talent management
  - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
- Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC)
  - Information Security (especially the CISO)
  - Data Protection Officer
  - Compliance Officers
  - Risk Management
  - Internal Auditors
  - Legal team
  - Financial risk
- Information Technology
  - CTO
  - Software Architects
  - Cyber Security
  - Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
  - Platform
  - Business Application Owners
  - Engineering Managers

### Workforce IAM

#### HR-Driven Identity Lifecycle

The HR department is the one that knows who is joining, who is leaving, who is
moving to another job within the company, who is on vacation, sick leave, parental
leave, etc. Their system should expose for each employee at least the name that
should be used for them within the company (might be different from their legal
name, which is only required by HR to sign contracts), the start and end dates
(if applicable) of the contract, department, role, line manager, and absences.

Their database should be the source of truth for identities in the workforce. Other
sources of truth can exist, but there must be a good reason for the exception.
Furthermore, for such sources there needs to be an owner and at least one deputy
responsible for the identities, and the identities need to be marked as “untrusted”
and have a label with the source to help the Information Security team evaluate
any access requests to internal systems.

#### Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) connected with the Asset Catalog

It is not possible to automate access to applications without knowing whether the
application is in review, ready to be used or about to be decommissioned, who the
Asset Owner is, what roles can be assigned to users, etc.

All applications and services must reside in an Asset Catalog, be labeled with the
appropriate status and Information Assurance (IA) levels, and have assigned Asset
Owners (and deputies), Application Administrators, and Infrastructure Administrators.

When selecting new applications and services, ensure that new systems have an
appropriate interface for automated provisioning, preferring systems with SAML,
SCIM, OpenID Connect, OAuth or at least appropriate API endpoints (or even better
a supported connector for your IGA. See [Evolveum Identity Connectors and Resources][evolveum-connectors]
as an example).

#### Automated Provisioning

The HR department can provide us with some information about employees, but it
is up to the Line Manager, with the help of the Asset Owners (and the Information
Security team when in doubt), to determine which roles to assign them for day-to-day
work (and it is preferable to use Profiles that aggregate access, e.g., a person
working on a project will need access to the relevant chat channels, project emails,
related services, etc.).

All access and communication channels necessary for people's daily work should be
granted according to their profiles during on-boarding, based on their employment
relationship, location, sub-company, department, their role in the teams, projects
to which they are assigned, etc.

The exclusive use of RBAC to grant people access to services and applications will
lead to a proliferation of roles that will quickly become unmanageable. My advice
is to use a Policy-Based approach in a Zero Trust architecture.

All administrative access must be granted using short just-in-time credentials
that needs approval. The approval process can be automated for exceptional cases
using policies (e.g., an on-call engineer needs to work on a service they are
assigned to during an incident).

#### Procedure and Processes

Many procedures and processes will benefit from a well-built IAM infrastructure.

These include, but are not limited to:

- Business Continuity
- Disaster Recovery
- Internal Audit

### Note

This project is ambitious and constantly evolving.\
In the [To Do](docs/TODO.md) document I try to keep track of what has been
implemented and what is planned to be added.

## 🐣 Getting started

This project will create and provision 3 instances:

- an [ansible][ansible] controller (also used to host the internal DNS server)
- a [Kubernetes][kubernetes] cluster (a single instance for now)
- a Linux desktop with [Xfce Desktop Environment][xfce]

You can see [screenshots](docs/screenshots.md) of some of the applications
that will be provisioned.

> **Warning**
>
> To keep the code as clean as possible, for the time being, this project is not
> designed to be backward compatible.
>
> Instances are expected to be destroyed and recreated as new code may rename,
> remove, or modify resources in ways that could break previous deployments.

### ⚙️ Setup

#### Dependencies

- [Jsonnet][jsonnet]
- [Multipass][multipass] or [VirtualBox][virtualbox]

#### Run

```sh
./project-management -a
```

### 💻 Linux desktop Instance

#### Connect using Remote Desktop

Use any RDP client, such as [Windows App][microsoft-windows-app] (formerly known
as [Microsoft Remote Desktop][microsoft-remote-desktop]) or [FreeRDP][freerdp],
to connect to the `linux-desktop` instance.

- user: **ubuntu**
- password: **ubuntu**

The IP Address is the first entry from `ipv4` when running the following command:

```sh
./platform/instances-script-generator/generated/instances-status.sh linux-desktop
```

#### Test self-signed certificates

The ansible scripts should have installed the self-signed root certificate
inside the linux-desktop instance.

To test that the services are using the proper DNS and certificates, open a
terminal in `linux-desktop` and type:

```sh
~/bin/check-instance-config.sh
```

The result should be similar to the [OpenSSL Checks](./docs/screenshots.md#openssl-checks)
screenshot.

#### Complete Setup

> **Note:** required to run only once

##### Configure environment variables and shell completion

Open a terminal and type:

```sh
# Configure iam-demo-tech k8s cluster as default
echo 'export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-iam-demo-tech' | sudo tee --append /etc/bash.bashrc
# Add kubectl completion
kubectl completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kubectl
# Add kustomize completion
kustomize completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/kustomize
# Add helm completion
helm completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/helm
# Open a new shell tab or start a new shell to apply the changes
exec $SHELL
```

##### Configure Forgejo ssh keys

Open a terminal to generate the ssh keys.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ubuntu@iam-demo.test"
```

Open a [Forgejo](https://git.iam-demo.test) in a browser and login using the
credentials from [Connect using linux-desktop browser](#connect-using-linux-desktop-browser).

Open a terminal and copy your public ssh key in the clipboard.

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | tee >(xclip -selection clipboard); echo ''
```

Open [Manage SSH Keys in Forgejo](https://git.iam-demo.test/user/settings/keys)
in a browser and paste the public key.

### 🧑‍💻 Access Kubernetes cluster

#### Connecting from the console

Access `ansible-controller` shell using:

```sh
./platform/instances-script-generator/generated/instance-shell.sh ansible-controller
```

or connect to `linux-desktop` [using Remote Desktop](#connect-using-remote-desktop)
and open a terminal.

You can also access `linux-desktop` shell using:

```sh
./platform/instances-script-generator/generated/instance-shell.sh linux-desktop
```

To check the Kubernetes configuration, type:

```sh
kubectl config view
```

The output should be like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://iam-control-plane.iam-demo.test:6443
  name: default
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: default
    user: default
  name: default
current-context: default
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: default
  user:
    client-certificate-data: DATA+OMITTED
    client-key-data: DATA+OMITTED
```

The [kubernetes](kubernetes/) folder is mounted inside the `ansible-controller`
under `/kubernetes`.

#### Connect using linux-desktop browser

Connect to `linux-desktop` [using Remote Desktop](#connect-using-remote-desktop).

Open Firefox inside the instance, and use the following URLs:

> **Note:** You can also find them in the Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar under
> "Managed bookmarks".

- Grafana: <https://grafana.iam-demo.test>
  - user: admin
  - password: grafana-admin
- Forgejo: <https://git.iam-demo.test>
  - user: forgejo-admin
  - password: forgejopw123!
- Prometheus: <https://prometheus.iam-demo.test>
- Alertmanager: <https://alertmanager.iam-demo.test>
- Consul: <https://consul.iam-demo.test>
- Keycloak: <https://keycloak.iam-demo.test>

To access Traefik or Kubernetes dashboards, follow the instructions in the
respective subsections.

##### Traefik Dashboard

Open a terminal and start port forwarding using:

```sh
KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-iam-demo-tech
kubectl port-forward \
  --namespace kube-system \
  $(kubectl get pods \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --selector "app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik" \
    --output=name) \
  9000:9000
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:9000/dashboard/> in a browser.

##### Kubernetes Dashboard

Generate a token, print it and copy it to the clipboard:

```sh
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user | tee >(xclip -selection clipboard); echo ''
```

Start the proxy:

```sh
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard-kong-proxy 8443:443
```

Access the kubernetes-dashboard in a web browser opening:

<https://localhost:8443/>
